### What is Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break down the work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
These intervals are known as "Pomodoro", the plural of the Italian word pomodoro for "tomato". During this section, you should concentrate on your work and avoid interruptions. When on breaks, you can leave your space to have a drink.
